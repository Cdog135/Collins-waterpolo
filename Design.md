# Water Polo Game Simulator

## Purpose
Fulfill the need that all water polo fans have been yearning for: a water polo game app! It provides a unique single-player water polo game experience where any user can play this sport that doesn’t get the love it deserves.

## Target Audience
My target audience is primarily targeted at young adolescents who are interested in aquatic sports, or people who enjoy sports games and are interested in sports and want to find more types of play. But, it is not limited to any particular demographic or age group. This addresses the lack of water polo games in the sports gaming genre.

## Functionality
- There is a start screen that welcomes the user to the website with some form of greeting. 
- Then you will be prompted with multiple water polo players that you can use.
- the background should represent a water polo pool.
- Place the selected player in the middle of the pool, along with two other waterpolo players on your team. 3v3.
- Add a goalie near the goal line in a different color to signify the opponent.
- Implement basic animations to simulate movement, such as the player circle moving towards the goal when shooting, and the goalie circle moving to the selected direction to try and block.
- If the shot bypasses the goalie’s position, increase the score for the player.
- Display the score at the top of the screen, similar to the example image, to keep track of successful shots.
- Keep the design minimal, focusing only on the essentials (player, goalie, goal area, shot buttons, and score) for simplicity and clarity.


## User Flow
1. Greeted with a welcome message and prompted to select a player.
2. After selection, the game transitions to the main gameplay screen.
3. The selected player is positioned in the middle of the pool, facing the goal.
4. The user can shoot or pass in the direction in they are moving.
5. The game keeps track of the user’s score.
6. The user can choose to replay the game or exit the game.
7. The game ends when a team scores 3 goals.

## Aesthetics
- **Water Polo Player**: Each water polo player will be wearing water polo caps.
- **Graphics**: Uses water polo-themed graphics, with simplified player and goalie avatars.
- **Typography**: Bold, modern fonts that are easy to read and contribute to the sporty theme.
