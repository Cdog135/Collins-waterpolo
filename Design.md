# Water Polo Game Simulator

## Purpose
Fulfill the need that all water polo fans have been yearning for: a water polo game app! It provides a unique single-player water polo game experience where any user can play this sport that doesn’t get the love it deserves.

## Target Audience
My target audience is primarily targeted at young adolescents who are interested in aquatic sports, or people who enjoy sports games and are interested in sports and want to find more types of play. But, it is not limited to any particular demographic or age group. This addresses the lack of water polo games in the sports gaming genre.

## Functionality
- There is a start screen that welcomes the user to the website with some form of greeting. 
- Then you will be prompted with multiple water polo players that you can use.
- Once you choose a player, your player will be in the middle of a water polo pool, and the perspective of the user will be behind the player facing towards the goal. 
- There will be a goalie who is treading water to stay afloat. 
- The selected player appears in the water, facing the goal, and the user has three shot options (left, middle, or right).
- The selected player can also shoot a skip shot that bounces off the water. 
- The goalie will randomly choose one of the six directions to block (left skip, middle skip, right skip, left, middle, right), adding an element of surprise, and will only block the shot if they choose correctly

There is also a multiplayer option where you can play against a friend. where the friend can choose the goalie and their direction of block.

## User Flow
1. Greeted with a welcome message and prompted to select a player.
2. Once a player is chosen, the game transitions to the shooting screen, where the user selects a shot direction.
3. Depending on the goalie’s choice, the shot is either blocked or scored.
4. Option to replay the game after each round.
5. The game keeps track of the user’s score.
6. The user can choose to replay the game or exit the game.
7. the user has a certain amount of "lives" so it's a game to try and get the highest streak

## Aesthetics
- **Water Polo Player**: Each water polo player will be wearing water polo caps.
- **Graphics**: Uses water polo-themed graphics, with simplified player and goalie avatars.
- **Typography**: Bold, modern fonts that are easy to read and contribute to the sporty theme.
