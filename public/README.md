My game is actually quite simple. There really are three parts to it so far the GameController which handles user inputs (dragging or swiping on mobile), GameElement which handles the ball, goal, and other game objects, and the SceneManager which handles the 3D environment and rendering. The GameController is the most complex as it has to handle user inputs and then pass that information to the GameElement which then updates the scene. The SceneManager is the simplest as it just has to render the scene and handle resizing. No special instructions and should be pretty easy to follow, and firebase should work.
