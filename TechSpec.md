## Game Tech Spec
# Tech Stack
I have chosen to use the Three.js framework for this game. Three.js provides excellent tools for creating 3D graphics and handling user interactions in the browser. The framework's robust documentation, large community, and built-in physics capabilities make it ideal for creating an interactive water polo game.
Contenders

* Babylon.js: While powerful, it would be overkill for our simple game mechanics
A-Frame: More focused on VR/AR which isn't needed for this game
* PlayCanvas: Requires account creation and hosting setup, making development more complex


# Architecture
1. SceneManager P0
Manages the 3D environment and rendering.
Variables

- scene (THREE.Scene): Main 3D scene container P0
- camera (THREE.PerspectiveCamera): Game camera view P0
- renderer (THREE.WebGLRenderer): Handles rendering P0
- waterPlane (THREE.Mesh): Animated water surface P0
- ball (THREE.Mesh): The water polo ball P0
- goal (THREE.Group): Goal structure with posts and net P0

* Methods

- createGoalPosts: Builds the goal structure with posts and net P0
- animateWater: Creates water movement effect P0
- handleResize: Manages window resize events P0
- render: Main rendering loop P0

2. InputManager P0
Handles user interactions with the game.
Variables

isMoving (boolean): Tracks if ball is in motion P0
targetPosition (THREE.Vector3): Ball's target location P0
canShoot (boolean): Whether shooting is allowed P0
isDragging (boolean): If ball is being dragged P0
raycaster (THREE.Raycaster): For ball selection P0
mouse (THREE.Vector2): Tracks mouse/touch position P0

Methods

handleInputStart: Processes mouse/touch start P0
handleInputMove: Processes mouse/touch movement P0
handleInputEnd: Processes mouse/touch end P0
setupEventListeners: Sets up all input event handlers P0

3. GameElements P0
Manages game object creation and properties.
Variables

sphereGeometry (THREE.IcosahedronGeometry): Ball geometry P0
sphereMaterial (THREE.MeshPhongMaterial): Ball material P0
waterGeometry (THREE.PlaneGeometry): Water surface geometry P0
waterMaterial (THREE.MeshPhongMaterial): Water material P0

Methods

createBall: Initializes the water polo ball P0
createWater: Creates the water surface P0
createLighting: Sets up scene lighting P0
resetBallPosition: Returns ball to starting position P0


User Interface
1. On-Screen Elements P0

Goal has physical posts and net
Shooting bounds checking

3. Water Effects P0

Animated water surface
Semi-transparent water plane
Reflective properties


Technical Requirements
1. Performance P0

Smooth 60 FPS gameplay
Efficient 3D rendering
Optimized physics calculations

2. Browser Support P0

Modern browser compatibility
WebGL support required
Touch device support

3. Asset Management P0
